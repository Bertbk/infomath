## <a name="ADMesh"></a> ADMesh

> "*ADMesh is a program for processing triangulated solid meshes. Currently, ADMesh only reads the [STL file format](stl_file_format.htm)
> that is used for rapid prototyping applications, although it can write [STL](stl_file_format.htm), [VRML](vrml.htm), [OFF](off.htm), and
> [DXF (voir AutoCAD)](autocad_dxf.htm) files.*"

### Features

* Read and write binary and **ASCII** [STL](stl_file_format.htm) files

* Check [STL](stl_file_format.htm) files for flaws (i.e. unconnected facets, bad normals)

*  Repair facets by connecting nearby facets that are within a given tolerance

*  Fill holes in the mesh by adding facets.

*  Repair normal directions (i.e. facets should be CCW)

*  Repair normal values (i.e. should be perpendicular to facet with length=1)

*  Remove degenerate facets (i.e. facets with 2 or more vertices equal)

*  Translate in x, y, and z directions

*  Rotate about the x, y, and z axes

*  Mirror about the xy, yz, and xz planes

*  Scale the part by a factor

*  Merge 2 [STL](stl_file_format.htm) files into one

*  Write an [OFF](off.htm) file

*  Write a [VRML](vrml.htm) file

*  Write a [DXF (voir AutoCAD)](autocad_dxf.htm) file

*  Calculate the volume of a part

## <A NAME="ARPACK"></A> ARPACK

> "*ARPACK++ is an object-oriented version of the ARPACK package. ARPACK is a well known collection of [Fortran](fortran.htm) subroutines
> designed to compute a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large scale sparse matrices and pencils. It implements a variant of the Arnoldi
> process for finding eigenvalues called Implicit restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM) and is capable of solving a great variety of problems from
> single precision positive definite symmetric problems to double precision complex non-Hermitian generalized problems.*

> *ARPACK++ is a collection of classes that offers [C++](c.htm) programmers an interface to ARPACK. It preserves the full capability,
> performance, accuracy and low memory requirements of the [Fortran](fortran.htm) package, but takes advantage of the [C++](c.htm)
> object-oriented programming environment.*
	    
> *ARPACK is a collection of [Fortran](fortran.htm) 77 subroutines designed to solve large scale eigenvalue problems.*

> *The package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a general n by n matrix A. It is most appropriate
> for large sparse or structured matrices A where structured means that a matrix-vector product w ← Av requires order n rather than the
> usual order n2 floating point operations. This software is based upon an algorithmic variant of the Arnoldi process called the Implicitly
> Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM). When the matrix A is symmetric it reduces to a variant of the Lanczos process called the Implicitly
> Restarted Lanczos Method (IRLM). These variants may be viewed as a synthesis of the Arnoldi/Lanczos process with the Implicitly Shifted QR
> technique that is suitable for large scale problems. For many standard problems, a matrix factorization is not required. Only the action
> of the matrix on a vector is needed.*

> *ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric, nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant application
> areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k) eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest real part or
> largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order of n.k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur basis vectors
> for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically accurate
> eigenvectors are available on request.*

> *PARPACK (Parallel ARPACK) is an extension of the ARPACK software package used for solving large scale eigenvalue problems on distributed
> memory parallel architectures.  The message passing layers currently supported are [BLACS](blacs.htm) and [MPI](mpi.htm).*"

> efficient [BLAS](blas.htm) implementation, as well as a few routines from [LAPACK](lapack.htm).*"
