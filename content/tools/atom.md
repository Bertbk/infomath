As [VSCode]({{< ref "tools/vscode.md">}}) is also open-source but seems to be much robust than Atom (and less CPU-demanding), we now recommend to use [VSCode]({{< ref "tools/vscode.md">}})  instead of Atom

[^1]: Note that GitHub has been [bought by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) which is developping the text editor [VSCode]({{< ref "tools/vscode.md">}}) .
