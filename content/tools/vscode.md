## Read the Documentation


[The Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs) is exhaustive and detailed: **read the doc!** This is even more true before installing a (random) package: the functionnality you are looking for is probably in the core of vscode! At least, read the [Basic Editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics). For every languages or functionnality ([intellisence](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), [debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging),...), the documentation provides :

- Obviously: shortcuts, functionnalities, ...
- A list of useful associated packages 


## Useful shortcuts

- `ctrl` + `p` : command prompt to select file (add a `>` to use extension)
- `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` : command prompt (for extension)


## Packages: everything you need!

We recommend the user to install only packages that have **many users** and to give priority to **recommended** packages. Here is a list of some packages that we tested (and approved!). Obviously keep the number of packages as small as possible: if you don't do C/C++, do not install the C/C++ package.
