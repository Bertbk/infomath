## Promises

Using the static web generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the wonderful theme [Hugo-Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/), we promise to:

1. Build a professional webpage in less than 10 minuts that [looks like this](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/)
2. Do not write a single line of neither HTML nor CSS: only [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is very simple to learn!
3. That's already a lot

## Tools needed

1. [Optional but highly recommended] Git and a [Github]({{<ref "tools/github.md">}}) or [Gitlab(.com)]({{<ref "tools/gitlab.md">}}) (but not the local Gitlab!) account
2. A good text editor: we recommend [VSCode]({{<ref "tools/vscode.md" >}})
3. [Optionnal: to work locally] Hugo (v. 0.48 compiled with 1.11), see [documentation for installation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/):
  1. Mac users: install hugo via [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
  2. Linux users: Sadly, compile Go and Hugo yourself (package are currently outdated)
  3. Windows users: well I don't know

## Let's do it!

### Build the basic webpage

All the stages are detailed on the [exhaustive documentation of Hugo Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) but we do remind some of them here. We assume you have a Github account but it is the same if you own a Gitlab(.com) one:

1. Have Github/Gitlab.com account
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
3. Provide the following link: https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart
4. Allow Netlify to modify your github/gitlab account
5. Choose a repo name (*e.g* "webpage")

At this stage, you already have a basic but working  website. The URL is however UGLY:

1. In your Netlify account: `Settings` â†’ `Domain managment`: Change the URL base name (*e.g* myname.netlify.com)
2. Check again on the new URL!

Every time you do a `push` to your remote Git reposity, Netlify will rebuild your website. In case the rebuild failed, you can access the log to correct the mistake. Rebuilding the website takes about 20seconds.

### Local version

You have to install Hugo on your computer (see above). We assume that you want your folder to be named `webpage`.

- Clone the repository

```bash
> git clone https://path_to_repo webpage
```
- In a terminal and **in the folder**, launch

```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> hugo serve
```
- Launch your browser and go to  http://localhost:1313

### Update theme

```bash
> sh update_academic.sh
```

And do not forget to `commit` and `push` !

### Send modification to remote

- Ask Git to track new file :

```bash
> git add /path/to/newfile
```
- (Lazy version) Commit every changes in the track files

```bash
> git commit -a -m "Message of the commit"
```
- Push to the remote

```bash
> git push
```

Refresh your webpage, it should be actualized in the minut.

{{% alert warning %}}
Please, try to never `commit` a broken code, *i.e* a code that Hugo fails to build. Always check if everything is fine locally!

### `/config.toml`

This is the main config file: choose the options you want by filling the blanks spaces (quite intuitive)

### Add/Modify content...

For every operations of that kind, [we refer to the documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/).
